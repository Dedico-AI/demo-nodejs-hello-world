## 🔍 API Endpoints

- `GET /` - Main route, displays "Hello World" page
- `GET /health` - Health check endpoint (returns JSON status)

## 🧪 Testing the Application

To verify the application is working:

1. **Homepage Test:**
   Visit the root URL - you should see "Hello World" displayed

2. **Health Check Test:**
   Visit `/health` endpoint - you should see JSON response:
   ```json
   {
     "status": "healthy",
     "timestamp": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"
   }
   ```

## 📝 Environment Variables

The application uses the following environment variables:

- `PORT` - Port number for the server (default: 3000)
  - Both Vercel and Railway automatically set this when deployed

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Cannot find module 'express'"
**Solution:** Run `npm install` to install dependencies

### Issue: "Port already in use"
**Solution:** Either stop the process using port 3000, or set a different PORT environment variable:
```bash
PORT=3001 npm start
```

### Issue: Application not loading on Vercel/Railway
**Solution:**
- For Vercel: Ensure `vercel.json` is present and properly configured
- For Railway: Ensure your `package.json` has the correct `start` script
- Both platforms should automatically detect it as a Node.js app
